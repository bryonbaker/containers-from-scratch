# Containers from Scratch

## Introduction
This presentation is based heavily on content from Julian Friedman, Liz Rice and Ed King. The CGROUPS content is inspired by a post I read from Sina Tehrani. They all use the same codebase so I am not sure who had the original thought... But in software development we stand on the shoulders of giants.
